# Description: Provides core functions for managing SSH keys and interacting

# Dependencies: Relies on functions from lib/logging.sh (log_debug, log_info, log_error, log_warn)
#               Relies on functions from lib/agent.sh (ensure_ssh_agent)
#               Relies on global variables set by the main script:
#                 - VALID_KEY_LIST_FILE: Path to the persistent list of keys to load.
#                 - SSH_DIR: Path to the user's SSH directory.
#                 - PLATFORM: OS type ("Darwin", "Linux", etc.) - used indirectly via `uname`.
#                 - KEYS_LIST_TMP: Path to a temporary file for listing discovered keys.
#                 - ACTION: (Used by list_current_keys) Current script action for context hints.

#
# @description Reads a list of key file basenames from $VALID_KEY_LIST_FILE,
#              constructs full paths, and adds them to the ssh-agent.
#              Supports both bulk addition (single ssh-add call) and per-key addition.
# @arg        [--bulk] Optional flag to use a single ssh-add command for all keys.
# @arg        [--quiet] Optional flag to suppress user-facing printf messages (log only).
# @requires   Global variables $VALID_KEY_LIST_FILE, $SSH_DIR.
# @modifies   Adds keys to the running ssh-agent.
# @return     0 If at least one key was successfully added (or ssh-add bulk reports status 0 or 1).
# @return     1 If no keys were found to add, no keys were successfully added,
#               or a critical ssh-add error occurred (e.g., status 2+).
# @prints     Status messages to stdout unless --quiet is used.
# @stderr     None directly (errors logged).
# @depends    Global variables: VALID_KEY_LIST_FILE, SSH_DIR.
#             Functions: log_debug, log_info, log_error, log_warn.
#             External command: ssh-add, printf, read, uname, basename.

# @requires   An accessible ssh-agent (checked via ssh-add -l).
# @modifies   Removes all identities from the running ssh-agent.
# @return     0 If the operation was cancelled by the user OR if all keys were
#               successfully deleted (or if no keys were present initially).
# @return     1 If there was an error connecting to the agent OR if the underlying
#               `delete_keys_from_agent` function failed unexpectedly after confirmation.
# @prints     Status messages about loaded keys, confirmation prompt, and success/failure
#             messages to stdout/stderr.
# @reads      User input ('y'/'Y') from /dev/tty for confirmation.
# @stdout     Messages about loaded keys, confirmation prompt, cancellation/success message.
# @stderr     Error messages (e.g., connection failure).
# @depends    Functions: delete_keys_from_agent, log_debug, log_info, log_error, log_warn.
#             External command: ssh-add, wc, read, printf, echo.
