# SSH Key Manager

A comprehensive SSH key management tool that provides a menu-driven interface for managing SSH keys in the ssh-agent. This tool is designed to simplify the process of managing SSH keys across different platforms while providing robust error handling and logging capabilities.

## Features

- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for managing SSH keys.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both macOS and Linux systems.
- **Automatic SSH Agent Management**:
  - Automatically starts ssh-agent if not running.
  - Manages agent environment variables via a persistent file (`~/.config/agent.env` by default).
  - Handles key loading and unloading.
- **Key Management**:
  - Load keys based on finding files with matching `.pub` counterparts in the SSH directory.
  - Load specific key(s) interactively from the list of found keys.
  - List currently loaded keys (numbered list).
  - Delete individual keys from the agent interactively.
  - Delete all keys at once.
- **Directory Management**:
  - Interactively set the SSH directory to use during a menu session.
  - Validate SSH directory permissions.
  - Support for custom SSH directories via environment variable (`SKM_SSH_DIR`).
  - Automatic creation of the default SSH directory (`~/.ssh`) if it doesn't exist.
- **Comprehensive Logging**:
  - Platform-specific log locations.
  - Log rotation (1MB max size, 5 files).
  - Detailed operation logging.
  - Error and warning tracking.

## Requirements

- Bash shell (version 4.0 or higher recommended for `mapfile`).
- Standard Unix utilities (`find`, `basename`, `wc`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `chmod`, `grep`, `date`, `ps`, `rm`, `mv`, `seq`, `sleep`, `dirname`).
- SSH tools installed (`ssh-add`, `ssh-agent`).
- Write permissions to log directory.
- Read/Execute permissions to the target SSH directory.

## Installation

1. Download the script:

   ```bash
   curl -o sshkeymanager.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggthedev/SSHKEYSMANAGER/refs/heads/main/sshkeymanager.sh # Replace with the actual raw URL
   # OR clone the repository
   # git clone https://github.com/ggthedev/SSHKEYSMANAGER.git
   # cd YOUR_REPO
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x sshkeymanager.sh
   ```

3. (Optional) Move to a directory in your PATH for global access:

   ```bash
   sudo mv sshkeymanager.sh /usr/local/bin/sshkeymanager
   ```

## Usage

The script can be run with various command-line options or using an interactive menu.

```bash
./sshkeymanager.sh [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

*   `-l`, `--list`: List keys currently loaded in the ssh-agent.
*   `-a`, `--add`: Find potential keys, clear agent, add found keys.
*   `-f <file>`, `--file <file>`: Load keys listed in `<file>` after clearing agent.
*   `-D`, `--delete-all`: Delete all keys from agent (prompts for confirmation).
*   `-m`, `--menu`: Show the interactive text-based menu interface.
*   `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable verbose (DEBUG level) logging.
*   `-h`, `--help`: Display the help message.

**macOS Argument Parsing Note:**

While the script functions on macOS without extra dependencies, installing `gnu-getopt` is recommended for the best command-line experience:

```bash
brew install gnu-getopt
```

This enables support for features like combined short options (e.g., `-lv`) and long options (e.g., `--list`) which the default macOS `getopt` does not handle. If `gnu-getopt` is not installed, the script will fall back to a simpler parser, and only single short options (e.g., `-l -v`) will work.

### Interactive Menu Mode (`sshkeymanager -m`)

The script provides the following menu options:

1.  **Set SSH Directory**: Interactively change the directory to scan for keys during the current menu session.
2.  **List Current Loaded Keys**: Display a numbered list of keys currently loaded in ssh-agent (shows fingerprints).
3.  **Load Key(s)**: Presents a numbered list of potential private keys (found via `.pub` check) and allows selecting one or more keys to add to the agent.
4.  **Delete Single Key from Agent**: Presents a numbered list of potential private keys and allows selecting one to remove from the agent (`ssh-add -d`).
5.  **Delete All Keys from Agent**: Remove all keys currently loaded in ssh-agent (`ssh-add -D`), after confirmation.
6.  **Display Log File Info**: Show the location and size of the current log file.
7.  **Reload Keys**: Deletes all keys from the agent (`ssh-add -D`) and then loads all potential private keys found (via `.pub` check) in the current SSH directory.
8.  **Quit**: Exit the program.

## Configuration via Environment Variables

Certain paths used by the script can be overridden by setting environment variables before running the script:

- `SKM_SSH_DIR`: Overrides the default SSH directory (`~/.ssh`).
- `SKM_LOG_DIR`: Overrides the auto-detected log directory.
- `SKM_LOG_FILENAME`: Overrides the default log filename (`sshkeymanager.log`).
- `SKM_VALID_KEYS_FILE`: Overrides the path to the internal list used by `-f` / Reload (`~/.config/sshkeymanager/ssh_keys_list`).
- `SKM_AGENT_ENV_FILE`: Overrides the path for the persistent agent environment file (`~/.config/agent.env`).

## Logging

The script maintains detailed logs of all operations.

- **Default macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/sshkeymanager/sshkeymanager.log`
- **Default Linux**: `/var/log/sshkeymanager/sshkeymanager.log` (if writable) or `~/.local/log/sshkeymanager/sshkeymanager.log`
- **Fallback**: `~/.ssh/logs/sshkeymanager.log`

Log files are rotated when they reach 1MB in size, keeping up to 5 backup files.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions for your SSH directory and the log directory.
- Use the `-v` (verbose) flag to enable debug logging for more detailed information.
- Check the log file specified by option `6` in the menu.

## `ssh_agent_setup.sh` - Automated Agent Setup (for Sourcing)

This script is designed to be **sourced** by your shell's startup files (preferably `.zprofile` or `.profile`) to ensure a single `ssh-agent` is running per login session and that necessary environment variables (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `SSH_AGENT_PID`) are exported correctly for process inheritance.

### Purpose

- Ensures a single `ssh-agent` is running per login session.
- Exports `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID` for use by subsequent processes.
